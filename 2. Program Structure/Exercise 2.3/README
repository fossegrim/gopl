popcount.FlatPopCount is the original PopCount and LoopedPopCount is the
rewritten one. benchmark.go benchmarks the functions.
---===---
$ go run benchmark.go
100000000 calls to FlatPopCount took 36.268256ms
100000000 calls to LoopedPopCount took 2.501241433s
---===---
As we can see FlatPopCount is much faster.
