This exercise was bad. It required more knowledge / further research than what
the book has covered so far. As a consequence the solution is hackish. It uses
two parallell maps, fileLines and counts. I know this is bad design, but I
didn't want to spend too much time studying outside of the book to learn how to
do this with one structure in Go. I also disregarded code quality in other parts
of the code since it would be terrible either way. Anyways it works the way that
I interpreted the exercise to request. Exercise was ambigious. It is unclear
whether it meant duplicate as duplicate in a single file or across them all. It
is also unclear how it should output the files. As for my interpretation of it,
see the source.

Other people have also had the same problem*.
