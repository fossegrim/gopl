Within this directory there are two images, supersampled_mandelbrot.png and
mandelbrot.png. mandelbrot.png is rendered by the mandelbrot.go version of
Exercise 3.5 and supersampled_mandelbrot.png is rendered by this exercise's
mandelbrot.go.

The code for this exercise is also very bad. I don't understand this domain at
all, which lead to using guesswork programming to for example finding out how
to find the proper offset etc. Either way it works and it's pretty cool :^).
